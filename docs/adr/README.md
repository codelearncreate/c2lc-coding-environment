# Architectural Decision Records

For non-trivial architecture changes, our team uses Architectural Decision
Records (ADRs) to propose, discuss, and agree on how/whether to update our
architecture. For more information on what an ADR is, check out:

1. [Michael Nygard's blog post on the topic](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
2. [The ADR GitHub organisation](https://adr.github.io)

We use [this template based on Nygard's blog post](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md)
as the starting point for our ADRs.

ADRs should be submitted as pull requests against this repository, which add a
new ADR to this directory. ADRs are named based on the order in which they are
created. For example, the first ADR created is named `ADR001.md`, the second is
`ADR002.md`. The order in which they are approved is reflected by the time the
file was merged.
