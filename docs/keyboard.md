# Key Bindings

Weavly supports two sets of keyboard shortcuts.  A keyboard shortcut provides
fast access to a range of Weavly's features using one or more key presses.
Keyboard shortcuts can be configured (or turned off) using the keyboard input
menu, which is displayed by default when the question mark key is pressed, or
when the keyboard icon is clicked.

The most basic shortcuts are activated by holding a key like alt, or holding
control and alt at the same time, and then pressing a particular letter.  Longer
shortcuts involve hitting a combination of keys to start a sequence, and then
entering additional letters.

In the instructions below, keys that need to be held at the same time are
indicated using plus signs, and keys that need to be entered separately are
divided using commas. For example, the shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + x, x` is
activated by holding control, alt, and x at the same time, releasing all keys,
and then hitting the x key again by itself.
